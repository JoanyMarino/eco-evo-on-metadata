# Materials needed:
* 8 beakers
* potatoes
* Distilled Water
* Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
* scale

# Metadata

Treatment: the two experimental conditions, A and B, in which a sample of potato is suspended in a beaker filled with the same total volume of Distilled Water:
* Treatment A: a single piece of potato (2 cm x 2cm x 2cm)
* Treatment B: 8 small cubes of potato (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm)

Concentration (% NaCl): the amount of NaCl dissolved in each beaker, can be either 0% (i.e., Distilled Water), 0.9%, 2%, and 5% NaCl

Final Weight (g): weight of the filled beaker at the end of the experiment

Initial Weight (g): weight of the filled beaker at the start of the experiment


# What to mark

Are all the variables (i.e. columns in the dataset) described?
Are units of measurements provided for all quantitative variables?
For qualitative variables, are different group or categories described exhaustively?
Is the distinction between initial and final conditions made clear?
